  - text: Social distancing, or physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical

      by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of
      times people come into close contact with each other.
  - text: The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through
      droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets
      of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands
      frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

  utter_faq_symptoms:
  - text: COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people
      will develop mild to moderate symptoms.Common symptoms:fever, tiredness, dry
      coughSome people may experience:aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose,
      sore throat, diarrhoea. On average it takes 5‚Äì6 days from when someone is infected
      with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days
  - text: The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from ranging from mild illness
      to pneumonia. Symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches.
  - text: Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate
      respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people,
      and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
      chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
  - text: People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild
      respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean
      incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). Most people infected with COVID-19
      virus have mild disease and recover.
  
  utter_faq_testing:
  - text: Covid-19 testing can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus (virus responsible for
      COVID-19) and includes methods that detect the presence of virus itself (RT-PCR
      and isothermal nucleic acid amplification) and those that detect antibodies
      produced in response to infection
  - text: COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and
      want to get tested, call your medical provider first. You can also visit your
      state or health department‚Äôs website to look for the latest local information
      on testing. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult
      to find a place to get tested.
  
  utter_faq_vaccine:
  - text: When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can
      take a few months to number of years for a new vaccine to be developed.
  - text: There is no specific treatment for disease caused by a novel coronavirus.
      However, many of the symptoms can be treated and therefore treatment based on
      the patient's clinical condition.
  - text: Currently hydroxychloroquine is being used to treat patients in case of
      severe illness."
  - text: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses. The 2019-nCOV is a virus and,
      therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
  
  utter_faq_vulnerable:
  - text: People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older
      people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes,
      heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the
      virus.
  - text: Current evidence on other coronavirus strains shows that while coronaviruses
      appear to be stable at low and freezing temperatures for a certain period, food
      hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through
      food.
